1. Practice with Ruby code
2. learn the difference between print and puts
    Terminal shows: if use puts "Hello World!", then enter
    Hello World
    => nil

    print "Hello World", then enter
    Hello World => nil

Conclusion:
puts add news line to the end of each agrument
print does not add a new line.
